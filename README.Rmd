# differential

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `differential` is to provide Automatic Differentiation for
arbitrary R code.

## Installation

You can install the development version of differential from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("fangzhou-xie/differential")
```

## Example

### Automatic differentiation

```{r}
library(differential)

e <- quote(3*x^2)
gradient(e, wrt(e))
```

### (Simple) Algebraic Simplification

```{r}
e <- quote(3*x^2+a*x^2)
simplify(e)
```
